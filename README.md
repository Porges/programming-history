# History of Programming Language Topics

Inspired by Cajori’s _A History of Mathematical Notations_, and/or *TV Tropes*.

> [On computing as pop culture:] … But pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future — it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from]… — [Alan Kay](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442)

> It is frequently claimed in American philosophy departments that, in order to be a philosopher, it is not necessary to revisit the history of philosophy. It is like the claim that one can become a painter without having seen a single work of Raphael, or a writer without having ever read the classics. Such things are theoretically possible; but the ‘primitive’ artist, condemned to an ignorance of the past, is always recognizable as such and rightly labelled as a *naïf*. It is only when we reconsider past projects revealed as utopian or as failures that we are apprised of the dangers and possibilities for failure for our allegedly new projects. The study of the deeds of our ancestors is thus more than an antiquarian pastime, it is an immunological precaution. — Umberto Eco, _The Search for the Perfect Language_
