# History of Programming Language Topics

Inspired by Cajori’s _A History of Mathematical Notations_, and/or *TV Tropes*.

> [On computing as pop culture:] … But pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future — it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from]… — [Alan Kay](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442)
